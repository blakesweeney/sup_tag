Sup Tag
========

A gem to make tagging messages in sup cleaner.

Usage
=====

This currently supports two methods to add tags, tag and archive. Tag adds tags
but does not remove the inbox tag. Archive will add a tag and remove the inbox
tag.



Note on Patches/Pull Requests
=============================
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
